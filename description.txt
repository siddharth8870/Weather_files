I request you to work on the below project and You can use the skills (Python, No SQL Database etc). It encompasses simple networking, multi-threading, database, graphing, configuration, classes. you can refer to internet anywhere to begin this project as well... 
1. Create account in https://openweathermap.org/api 
2. Get API access key , after creating api access key : key = "8ce0d56e5fbf4c7c2b09e351f7f88dd6" and the name = "Weather123".
3. Make a multi-threaded program to connect to API. 
3a. Locations to be monitored should be placed in configuration file. 
3b. configruation file should have refresh frequency (for free api, you should not make more than 60 per minute.. so make not more than 5 per minute..).
4. One thread to download 5 days/3 hour forecast. 
5. One thread to download weather maps. 
6. All data should be stored in database (mongodb) as seperate collections/table. 
7. One thread to open the latest weather map and display the map in window (should show last image as per last time stamp). 
8. Forecast threads should print out alerts if there is rain/snow or freeezing temperatures (‚ù§2 def farenheit) in any of forecast period. 
9. See if you use graph API to display forecast/previous 10 day data from database as a graph (prebuilt libraries are there to do this).
10. Once you complete the challenge, pls push the code to the Github.
